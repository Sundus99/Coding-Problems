**Loop Invariants - Sorted Matrix Search:** Search a Sorted Matrix Problem: The input consists of a
real number x and a matrix A[1..n, 1..m] of nm real numbers such that each row A[i, 1..m] is sorted
from left to right and each column A[1..n, j] is sorted from top to bottom. The goal is to determine
if the key x appears in the matrix. Design and analyze an iterative algorithm for this problem that
examines as few matrix entries as possible. Careful, if you believe that a simple binary search solves
the problem. Later we will ask for a lower bound and for a recursive algorithm
